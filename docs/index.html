		<h1>Data Visualization Project</h1>
		<div class="names">
			<p>For our project, we did data scraping on a publicly available Twitter API, that allows you to take a certain amount of the most recent tweets posted.<br>
				The data we retrieved contains different variables that we used for different analyses and visualizations.<br> 
				We decided to take around 1.000 tweets each for some specific topics and queries, related to the subject of data visualization.<br>
				The four topics and keywords we chose are: “visualization”, “matplotlib”, “tableau” and “powerbi”. <br>
				Through their analysis, it is possible to not only observe general behaviors of Twitter users, but also specifically analyze related terms and the discourse on the platform regarding the topic at hand. </p>

				<p>
					The first static visualization we have decided to produce is a scatterplot of the relationship between User Followers and Retweet Count, in fact, we put the first in the x-axes and the latter in the y-axes.<br>
					This plot allows us to determine whether it is required to have a big following on the platform in order to reach a wide audience and go viral. <br>
					On the other hand, they may show that having a higher number of followers is a prerequisite to having a viral tweet, as it makes it easier to reach a wider audience.<br>
					The results may indicate that that is not the case as the most popular tweets among those taken into consideration did not come from the accounts with the most followers, as there isn’t a linear relationship between the two variables.<br>
					This is a fundamental analysis of Twitter as a platform, as it defines whether the suggestion algorithms and timelines mechanism allows everyone to spread their ideas and reach a considerable audience, specifically using hashtags and keywords.

				<p>
					The second static visualization is a histogram depicting the length of the collected tweets.<br>
					This graph aims to see whether Twitter users are more likely to write as much as they can or prefer to keep things short.<br>
					There’s also a red line that indicates the mean length: its value, coupled with the visual course of the data, may either show that Twitter users do indeed gravitate towards writing more characters or that they do not.<br>
					The outcome of the graph may indicate that most of the users tend, in general, not to write as much as they can, this can indicate that many probably wouldn’t pay for the possibility to have more characters at their disposal.

				The first interactive visualization is a stacked bar chart of tweet sources by query.<br>
				Different bars for each of the queries are divided by colors into the types of devices from which the tweet was posted.<br>
				As some tweet sources are dominant compared to others, due to those devices being more commonly owned by Twitter users (ex. iPhone or Android), it is possible to select any number of tweet sources and exclude others.<br>
				This allows us to fully grasp their relationship in the different queries, potentially noticing considerable differences between the two sources when analyzing them as a duo, whose count may have looked very similar when looking at the entire set.

				The second interactive visualization is a tree map showing the frequency of specific words within the tweets. <br>
				More specifically, it is possible to write an input, which can be a word, a letter or a sign, and obtain the top words that start with the given input. <br>
				Moreover, by hovering on any of the cells of the graph, additional information can be obtained regarding the frequency and percentage of the words. <br>
				The purpose of this visualization is to understand the most common related terms to the subject and topic at hand, while being able to customize the search and still receive accurate and interesting information.<br>
				In the graph, we gave the word ‘data’ as input retrieving the shown result.
