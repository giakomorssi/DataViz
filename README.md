# DataViz

This is the Data Visualization project of Giacomo, Carlo and Alexandra.

It is about understanding the platform of Twitter, specifically when analyzing tweets about the topic of data visualization.
The first part of the code includes utilizing a Twitter API. However, as the key for it is now expired, we utilize a defined dataframe for the visualizations, from the file that we posted on this page (tweets.xlsx)
